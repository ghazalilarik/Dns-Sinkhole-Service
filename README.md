# Dns-Sinkhole-Service
This project is designed to help companies mitigate malicious domains within their networks. When a client attempts to access a known malicious domain, the traffic is rerouted to a sinkhole IP address. This allows organizations to safely mitigate threats by preventing access to malicious resources and logging attempted access.
